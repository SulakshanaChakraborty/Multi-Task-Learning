## Multi-Task Learning for Image Segmentation using attention blocks

This repo contains the code, data and pretrained models for "Enhancing Multi Task Learning for Image Segmentaion using soft attention blocks and self-supervised auxilary tasks. The full report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/SulakshanaChakraborty/Multi-Task-Learning/blob/main/MTL-Report.pdf). 

SegNet Based MTL model with auxilary tasks of Boundary box detection and Classification was implemented. Experiments were carried out by adding attention masks and additional self-supervised auxilary tasks of edge detection 

####  Steps to run the code
## Set up environment 
* Clone the repository
* Create an enviroment using the requirements.txt file
* To run inference on the MTL-attention model run : cw2_main.py -ts 'y'

For further deatils on training and running inference on different pre-trained models, please refer to instructions.txt.
